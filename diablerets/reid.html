<h4><i>Profinite rigidity and flexibility</i><br>Alan Reid</h4><section>
This talk will discuss to what extent residually finite groups are determined by their finite quotients.
In addition we discuss what properties of residually finite groups are "seen" by the
set of finite quotients.
All of this can be recast in terms of the profinite completions of the groups, and the methods we use require the technology of profinite groups.
